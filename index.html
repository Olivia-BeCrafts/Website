            <h2>A Bit About <span class="name">BE Crafts Ltd</span></h2>
            <p>
                BE Crafts Ltd is a woman-founded, woman-powered business. I design and make all of our
                products. My love of crafts and technology have come together in a creative collaboration
                resulting in toys and mobile apps. My love of my daughter has inspired me to create
                products that children will love and families will be happy for them to have and hold.
            </p>
            <p>
                Follow my lovable characters off the screen and into real life play! These characters will
                encourage and scaffold your child's healthy, happy habits and be a comforting playmate when
                screen time is over.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first product releases soon, watch this space!

            <h2>Meet Olivia</h2>
            <p>
                I am a maker, a software engineer, a mother. I started making toys for my daughter
                during the first lockdown. First crochet, then knitting and now sewing. The journey
                into making has changed our lives and brought us so much joy.
            </p>
            <p>
                My daughter's input and play testing is a crucial part of the making process :)
            </p>
            <p>
                We are from California and have relocated permanently to Scotland. We have fallen in
                love with the people and the place, Scotland will forever be home for us now.
